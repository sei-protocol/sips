Sei Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

## What is SIP?
SIP stands for Sei Improvement Proposal. An SIP is a design document that details a new feature for Sei, its processes, or the ecosystem. It provides the basis for the Sei community to propose a new idea and to assess its merits, its feasibility, and the implementation details.

## How do I create a SIP?
1. Read [SIP-1](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-1.md).
2. Fork the sips repository.
3. Copy the SIP template, using a temporary filename in the format sips/sip-temporary_title.md, into the sips directory.
4. Fill in the template, ensuring you follow the comments inside.
5. Assets may be embedded into the SIP. Include these assets in the assets directory, in a subdirectory named sip-temporary_title.
6. Submit a Pull Request to the sips repository from your forked repository.
